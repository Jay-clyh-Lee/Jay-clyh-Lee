- I had a very tough childhood and it led to a life full of hardships. As a result, I have a focus problem from depression, but I am recovering. I lost many career opportunities and chances to form cherishable relationships because I phased out at the moment and looked uninterested/indifferent or seemed slow. The truth is I lost focus while it was happening.... Of course, it hindered all areas in my life left alone my performance on exams. The cognitive assessments don't reflect my true ability. In order to get better, I need to channel my passion in the right career and a meaningful relationship.
